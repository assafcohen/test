Dear candidate,

Thank you for applying to work in Incredibuild.

This is coding test, it shouldn't take more than an hour or two.

This project build 2 executables, client and a server.

both use stl and asio.

The client executable is for ease of use while you take the test.

The client and server have a simple protocol:
1. client sends a string up to 1024 characters.
2. server receives the string 
3. calculate the count digits in the string.
4. and replies with  a byte for length to send and the result calculated in step 3 as a string. 
5. client receives reply and outputs reply to console.

server code is not complete, it should be fixed.
also some of the working parts are bug prone or may be rewritten for efficiency.

Please change server code only in order for it to work according to protocol.

good luck.
